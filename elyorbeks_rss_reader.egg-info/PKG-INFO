# Introduction to Python. Final task.
You are proposed to implement Python RSS-reader using  **python 3.9** - Ideally, but actually, any version above **python 3.6** is fine.

The task consists of few iterations. Do not start new iteration if the previous one is not implemented yet. **Usage of feedparser lib is prohibited.**

## Common requirements.
* Requires python
* Requires pip
## [Iteration 1] One-shot command-line RSS reader.
RSS reader should be a command-line utility which receives [RSS](wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) URL and prints results in human-readable format.

You are free to choose format of the news console output. The textbox below provides an example of how it can be implemented:

```shell
$ rss_reader.py "https://news.yahoo.com/rss/" --limit 1

[image 2: Nestor heads into Georgia after tornados damage Florida][2]Nestor raced across Georgia as a post-tropical cyclone late Saturday, hours after the former tropical storm spawned a tornado that damaged
homes and a school in central Florida while sparing areas of the Florida Panhandle devastated one year earlier by Hurricane Michael. The storm made landfall Saturday on St. Vincent Island, a nature preserve
off Florida's northern Gulf Coast in a lightly populated area of the state, the National Hurricane Center said. Nestor was expected to bring 1 to 3 inches of rain to drought-stricken inland areas on its
march across a swath of the U.S. Southeast.

```

Utility should provide the following interface:
```shell
usage: rss_reader.py [-h] [--version] [--json] [--verbose] [--limit LIMIT]
                     source

Pure Python command-line RSS reader.

positional arguments:
  source         RSS URL

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --version      Print version info
  --json         Print result as JSON in stdout
  --verbose      Outputs verbose status messages
  --limit LIMIT  Limit news topics if this parameter provided

```

In case of using `--json` argument your utility should convert the news into [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.
You should come up with the JSON structure on you own and describe it in the README.md file for your repository or in a separate documentation file.



With the argument `--verbose` your program should print all logs in stdout.

### Task clarification (I)

1) If `--version` option is specified app should _just print its version_ and stop.
2) User should be able to use `--version` option without specifying RSS URL. For example:
```
> python rss_reader.py --version
"Version 1.4"
```

## [Iteration 2] Distribution.

* Utility should be wrapped into distribution package with `setuptools`.
* This package should export CLI utility named `rss-reader`.


### Task clarification (II)
 
1) User should be able to run your application _both_ with and without installation of CLI utility,
meaning that this should work:

```
> python rss_reader.py ...
```

as well as this:  

```
> rss_reader ...
```
